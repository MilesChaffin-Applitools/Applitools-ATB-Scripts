## Prosper Flutter KYC Example project w/ Applitools

This is sample project to show how Applitools can be integrated into Applitools in a simple way. 
To run it, you first need to set your API key. Edit `flutterdemo.sh` and add your API key to the end of line 6,
where it says `export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=`. 

You will also need to add the Image Tester Jar to this folder, you can get it [here](https://github.com/applitools/ImageTester/releases).

Then to execute the test, just run `./flutterdemo.sh -visual` from this directory.

Happy testing!
